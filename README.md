# Startup Funding Case Study (Python) — Part 1 & Part 2

This repository contains a two-part analytical case study on **startup funding**, executed entirely in Python using industry-standard data analysis practices. The project walks through the complete lifecycle of a data analysis workflow — from data cleaning to deriving insights.

## **Overview**
This project aims to explore patterns, trends, and relationships in startup funding datasets. The notebooks guide you step-by-step through:
- Understanding the dataset
- Cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualizing key funding insights
- Identifying trends across years, sectors, and funding rounds

Both notebooks are structured, well-documented, and designed for anyone looking to practice real-world data analytics and visualization.

## **Repository Contents**

### **1. Part 1 — Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- Loading and inspecting raw datasets
- Handling missing values
- Data standardization and formatting
- Feature engineering
- Preparing the dataset for analysis

### **2. Part 2 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Univariate & multivariate analysis
- Sector-wise and stage-wise trends
- Investor analysis
- Year-over-year funding patterns
- Visual insights using matplotlib & seaborn

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**
- **Pandas** (data cleaning, preprocessing)
- **NumPy** (numerical operations)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (analysis environment)

## **Key Insights Uncovered**
Some highlights from the analysis include:
- Funding distribution across sectors
- Investor behavior and dominant funding rounds
- Growth trends over the years
- Correlations among key startup metrics

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to project directory:
   ```bash
   cd startup-funding-case-study
   ```
3. Install necessary libraries:

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the notebooks:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## **Future Improvements**
- Add predictive modeling (e.g., funding amount prediction)
- Build an interactive dashboard (Power BI/Tableau/Streamlit)
- Integrate external datasets for deeper insights
